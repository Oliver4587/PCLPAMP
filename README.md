PCLPAMP:A Prompt and Contrastive Learning-Based Model for Plant Antimicrobial Peptides Prediction
# Introduction
Plant antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), natural small molecular peptides in the plant defense system, not only exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and low toxicity but also play critical roles in plant growth and development, demonstrat-ing promising potential in agriculture and medicine. Recent studies have proposed various methods for AMP prediction, yet they generally suffer from drawbacks such as low efficiency, strong data dependence, and high computational costs. Therefore, a prompt and contrastive learning-based model for plant antimicrobial peptides prediction (PCLPAMP) is proposed. To be specific, continuous prompts are integrated to guide the protein LM ProtT5 in generating feature em-beddings for plant AMP prediction task. Simultaneously, through contrastive learning, the distribution of feature embeddings is optimized to enhance the dis-criminative of extracted features. The experimental results demonstrate that PCLPAMP achieves an accuracy of 94.15% and outperforms existing AMP pre-diction models on an independent test set. Compared to the current state-of-the-art model LMPred-T5XL UNI, the model improves accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and Matthews correlation coefficient by 2.63%, 2.86%, 2.39%, 2.7%, and 5.24%, respectively. Furthermore, compared to the low-rank adaptation (Lo-RA) fine-tuning approach, the PCLPAMP showed superior performance and computational efficiency, requiring only 27.5% of the trainable parameters to achieve comparable performance. Compared to the baseline model, PCLPAMP exhibits an average improvement of over 9% across all performance metrics, val-idating its effectiveness.
